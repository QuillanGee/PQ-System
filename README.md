# PQ-System
**Question:** What is the pq system? And how can we use it to define a theorem and an axiom?

**Defnition of PQ-System:** The PQ-system is a formal system introduced by Douglas Hofstadter in his book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid to illustrate how formal systems work. It is a simple string manipulation system, which allows us to explore basic ideas of formal logic, theorems, and axioms.

**Components of the PQ-System**
The PQ-system consists of three symbols:

P, Q, and - (dash).
The system works with strings that have the following general form:

𝑥𝑃𝑦𝑄𝑧
Where 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝑧 are strings of dashes ("-").

**Axiom of the PQ-system**
The PQ-system has only one axiom, which is a starting point or a rule that defines what is initially considered true. The axiom schema is:

xp-Q-x-p-
xp-Q-x-p-
In this schema, 𝑝 represents any number of dashes, and 𝑥 can represent any number of dashes as well. It allows us to create valid strings (theorems) within the system.
